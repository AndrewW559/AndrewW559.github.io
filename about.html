    b Games was founded in 2017 after I started creation of my first game, Deuterium. This is a product of many, many, hours spent in creation, playtesting, and graphic design.
    Deuterium is due to launch on Kickstarter in Summer 2019, with estimated delivery in 2020.

    <br>
    My name is Andrew Wood. I am currently a high schooler in Colorado. I started work on Deuterium early in my sophomore year and have been designing and perfecting nearly nonstop since then.
    Don't get me wrong, this is not an amateur work by any means. I have consulted with game industry professionals and Kickstarter experts such as Jamie Stegmaier (Stonemaier Games, <i>Scythe, Viticulture...</i>), Marc Neidlinger (Orange Nebula Games, <i>Epoch: The Awakening</i>),
    Isaac Childres (Cephalofair Games, <i>Gloomhaven, Forge War, Founders of Gloomhaven</i>).
